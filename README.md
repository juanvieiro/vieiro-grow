# Note

The solution has been kept as simple as possible according to the specified requirements.

Many features should be implemented in order to make this a code for production,
such to mention some of them:

- Delegation of functionalities in modules: controllers, services. Which also helps in unit testing
- Improve logging: use the corresponding tool for that and add different levels of logging.
- Environment variables: all of the current variables are hardcoded.
- Error handling

# Run

In the root of the project, run:

```
npm i && npm run start
```
